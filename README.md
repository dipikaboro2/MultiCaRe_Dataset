# üè• MultiCaRe Dataset Notebooks

This repository contains sample notebooks to show how the [MultiCaRe Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/10079370) was created. The code included in them is a simplified version of the actual code used.

Dataset creation consisted in the following steps:
1. [Querying case reports from PubMed](https://github.com/mauro-nievoff/MultiCaRe_Dataset/blob/main/1.%20How%20to%20Query%20Case%20Reports%20from%20PubMed%20using%20BioPython.ipynb)
2. [Extracting article metadata and relevant content](https://github.com/mauro-nievoff/MultiCaRe_Dataset/blob/main/2.%20Data%20Extraction%20from%20PMC's%20Case%20Reports)
3. [Turning captions into image labels](https://github.com/mauro-nievoff/MultiCaRe_Dataset/blob/main/3.%20Turning%20Captions%20into%20Image%20Labels.ipynb)
4. [Image preprocessing](https://github.com/mauro-nievoff/MultiCaRe_Dataset/blob/main/4.%20Image%20Preprocessing.ipynb)
