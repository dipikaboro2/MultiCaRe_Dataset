              "\"A 25-year-old man, previously healthy, was initially admitted due to slowly progressive headache with blurry vision and fever for nine months. The patient recalls ingesting raw camel milk, which is a major risk factor for brucellosis. There was no previous contact with a tuberculosis case. The headache worsened one week before his admission and the patient lost vision in the left eye. His vital signs and cognitive function were normal. Pupils were reactive, but the patient was barely seeing the flash light with his left eye. Ophthalmologic examination revealed an atrophic optic disc mainly with decreased visual acuity bilaterally. Extraocular muscles were intact. The remaining neurological examination was unremarkable.\\nHis diagnostic work up showed total white blood cell (WBC) count of 5.61 x 109 cells/mm3 and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 3.76 mg/L. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acid fast bacilli (AFB) stain and Mycobacterium tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction (MTB-PCR) were both negative. Blood and CSF cultures were positive for Brucella spp. His serum serological test was positive for B. melitensis and B. abortus. Antibody titers were 1:640 for both strains, just at the cutoff level for the serological diagnosis of the infection. CSF analysis showed elevated WBC count (170 cells/mm3 with 34.9% lymphocytes) and decreased glucose level (34.2 mg/dL). Serum glucose level at that time was 99 mg/dL. CSF protein level was 1.5 g/L while red blood cell (RBC) count was 7 cells/mm3. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain showed multiple, bilateral small dural-based nodular enhancements in both upper frontal lobes (Image 1). The patient was diagnosed with neurobrucellosis. Unfortunately, the patient has completely lost his vision in the left eye with weakened vision in the right eye because of a late presentation and delayed diagnosis. As such, the patient was immediately started on ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously (IV) every 12 h, doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 900 mg orally once daily for six weeks along with amikacin 400 mg IV every 12 h for the first three weeks. Three weeks after treatment was initiated, both antibody titers remained at 1:640, which was expected as Brucella antibodies may persist for months after conclusion of therapy. His repeated blood and CSF cultures returned negative a few days after treatment. A repeated MRI of the brain showed interval decrease in the number of the previously reported bilateral frontal leptomeningeal enhancing foci. However, small residual abnormal enhancing foci were still noted. Fortunately, no interval development of new lesions was seen (Image 2).\\nUpon completion of the IV regimen (amikacin and ceftriaxone), the patient was discharged on oral doxycycline 100 mg every 12 h and rifampin 300 mg every 8 h to be taken for 6 months. In an outpatient follow up visit three months later, the patient's vision on the right side was slightly improving. While B. melitensis antibody titer slightly decreased to 1:320, B. abortus antibody titer remained at 1:640. Three months later (six months after discharge), a repeated lumbar puncture showed improved CSF analysis with WBC count of 6 cells/mm3, RBC count of 1 cell/mm3, protein level of 0.55 g/L and glucose level of 46.8 mg/dL (serum glucose level was not obtained at the time of this test). Brucella antibody titer in the serum declined from 1:640 to 1:40 for both strains. At this visit, the decision was made to extend the treatment to 3-6 more months to ensure full recovery. Three months later, a repeated brain MRI showed no more meningeal enhancement and CSF analysis was normal; therefore, antibiotic treatment for brucellosis was stopped.\""

              "   'case_text': \"A 25-year-old man, previously healthy, was initially admitted due to slowly progressive headache with blurry vision and fever for nine months. The patient recalls ingesting raw camel milk, which is a major risk factor for brucellosis. There was no previous contact with a tuberculosis case. The headache worsened one week before his admission and the patient lost vision in the left eye. His vital signs and cognitive function were normal. Pupils were reactive, but the patient was barely seeing the flash light with his left eye. Ophthalmologic examination revealed an atrophic optic disc mainly with decreased visual acuity bilaterally. Extraocular muscles were intact. The remaining neurological examination was unremarkable.\\nHis diagnostic work up showed total white blood cell (WBC) count of 5.61 x 109 cells/mm3 and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 3.76 mg/L. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acid fast bacilli (AFB) stain and Mycobacterium tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction (MTB-PCR) were both negative. Blood and CSF cultures were positive for Brucella spp. His serum serological test was positive for B. melitensis and B. abortus. Antibody titers were 1:640 for both strains, just at the cutoff level for the serological diagnosis of the infection. CSF analysis showed elevated WBC count (170 cells/mm3 with 34.9% lymphocytes) and decreased glucose level (34.2 mg/dL). Serum glucose level at that time was 99 mg/dL. CSF protein level was 1.5 g/L while red blood cell (RBC) count was 7 cells/mm3. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain showed multiple, bilateral small dural-based nodular enhancements in both upper frontal lobes (Image 1). The patient was diagnosed with neurobrucellosis. Unfortunately, the patient has completely lost his vision in the left eye with weakened vision in the right eye because of a late presentation and delayed diagnosis. As such, the patient was immediately started on ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously (IV) every 12 h, doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 900 mg orally once daily for six weeks along with amikacin 400 mg IV every 12 h for the first three weeks. Three weeks after treatment was initiated, both antibody titers remained at 1:640, which was expected as Brucella antibodies may persist for months after conclusion of therapy. His repeated blood and CSF cultures returned negative a few days after treatment. A repeated MRI of the brain showed interval decrease in the number of the previously reported bilateral frontal leptomeningeal enhancing foci. However, small residual abnormal enhancing foci were still noted. Fortunately, no interval development of new lesions was seen (Image 2).\\nUpon completion of the IV regimen (amikacin and ceftriaxone), the patient was discharged on oral doxycycline 100 mg every 12 h and rifampin 300 mg every 8 h to be taken for 6 months. In an outpatient follow up visit three months later, the patient's vision on the right side was slightly improving. While B. melitensis antibody titer slightly decreased to 1:320, B. abortus antibody titer remained at 1:640. Three months later (six months after discharge), a repeated lumbar puncture showed improved CSF analysis with WBC count of 6 cells/mm3, RBC count of 1 cell/mm3, protein level of 0.55 g/L and glucose level of 46.8 mg/dL (serum glucose level was not obtained at the time of this test). Brucella antibody titer in the serum declined from 1:640 to 1:40 for both strains. At this visit, the decision was made to extend the treatment to 3-6 more months to ensure full recovery. Three months later, a repeated brain MRI showed no more meningeal enhancement and CSF analysis was normal; therefore, antibiotic treatment for brucellosis was stopped.\",\n",

She admitted drinking a small amount of raw milk several weeks before her presentation. She had no signs of meningitis and her neurological examination was normal. A lumbar puncture revealed no bacterial growth with CSF protein level of 0.7 g/L and glucose level of 126 mg/dL (serum glucose level was 268.2 mg/dL). CSF WBC count was <1 cell/mm3 and RBC count was 8 cells/mm3. AFB stain showed no Mycobacteria, and CSF MTB-PCR did not detect M. tuberculosis. Urine culture came back negative for any bacterial growth. However, a blood culture was positive for Brucella spp. In addition, both B. melitensis and B. abortus antibody titers in the serum exceeded 1:1280. An abdominal ultrasound was unremarkable. A transthoracic echocardiography followed by a transesophageal echocardiography were both normal. The patient was immediately started on ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 h, streptomycin 1 g intramuscularly (IM) once daily, doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 300 mg orally every 8 h daily for a total duration of 6 weeks. Her nausea and vomiting were treated with metoclopramide and ondansetron. Her back pain appeared to be due to disc prolapse rather than Brucella spondylodiscitis as was concluded from the MRI of her cervical and lumbosacral areas. After the patient completed 12 days of therapy, she was discharged on doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 300 mg orally every 8 h for 30 days and to continue her parenteral antibiotics as an outpatient. Upon follow up one month later, both Brucella antibody titers declined to 1:1280 in the serum. CRP level was 6.93 mg/L (no level was obtained at baseline). The patient was advised to continue the oral antibiotics for 6 more weeks while streptomycin and ceftriaxone were stopped. Two months later (three months post discharge), CRP level increased to 31 mg/L; nonetheless, antibody titers of B. melitensis and B. abortus declined to 1:640 and 1:320, respectively. As the patient appeared asymptomatic and clinically well, her antibiotics were stopped; though, she was advised to remain under supervision and to return for follow up in case of a potential relapse.',\n",

The patient also suffered from headache for three days which he described as being band-like surrounding his head. He reported regular contact with camels and occasional consumption of their raw milk. Three weeks before presentation, he was on vacation in Turkey where he consumed raw dairy products at a rural farm. He was febrile but his physical examination was normal otherwise. Lab investigations revealed a CRP level of 13.5 mg/L and CSF analysis showing a WBC count of 59 cells/mm3 (polymorphonuclear cells of 23% and lymphocytes of 71%), RBC count of 3 cells/mm3, protein level of 0.43 g/L and glucose level of 54 mg/dL (serum glucose was 100 mg/dL). His blood and CSF cultures were negative for Brucella spp. and so were the AFB satin, culture, and MTB-PCR. Nevertheless, his Brucella serum serology revealed an antibody titer of 1:1280 for both, B. melitensis and B. abortus. He was admitted as a case of neurobrucellosis and was started on ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 h, amikacin 720 mg (7.5 mg/kg) IV every 12 h, doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 900 mg orally once daily. Ten days later, he stared having spikes of fever reaching 40  C, a thorough physical examination and work up were done and they were negative for any potential infection or reason for fever. Thus, antibiotic-induced fever was suspected due to ceftriaxone, thus, it was discontinued despite the overall improvement of the patient's central nervous system symptoms. Ceftriaxone was replaced with ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 8 h. As the fever persisted and liver enzymes were noted to increase, rifampin was stopped as well. In less than a week, rifampin was reintroduced. However, 90 min after the dose, the patient experienced shortness of breath, rash, swelling and redness of skin. His reaction was managed immediately with antihistamine and hydrocortisone. This allergic reaction was presumed to be attributed to rifampin; hence, it was stopped and never introduced again. Moreover, the patient also complained of reduced hearing in his right ear which was suspected to be due to an ototoxic effect of amikacin which resulted in its discontinuation. In order to enhance the management of neurobrucellosis, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) double strength was started orally; yet, the patient had an episode of vomiting, so it was switched to IV which was well tolerated. Later on, as the patient was being prepared for discharge, IV TMP/SMX was stepped down to the oral formulation again. A lumbar puncture was repeated before discharge and showed an improvement from baseline with WBC count of 4 cells/mm3 (lymphocytes of 86%), RBC count of 9 cells/mm3, 0.33 g/L of protein and 61.2 mg/dL of glucose (serum glucose was not available at this point of time). Repeated antibody titers for B. melitensis and B. abortus were 1:640 and 1:320, respectively. The patient was discharged on doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h, ciprofloxacin 750 mg orally every 12 h and TMP/SMX double strength orally every 12 h. In his first outpatient visit one month after discharge, the patient admitted to voluntarily discontinuing TMP/SMX due to severe episodes of vomiting and refused to take it again; however, he continued taking doxycycline and ciprofloxacin which resulted in clinical success (after a total of 18 weeks on doxycycline and 16 weeks on ciprofloxacin).\",\n",

Physical examination revealed moderate lower limb weakness with foot drop. It was worse on the left side with lower motor neuron lesion findings. He had normal sensory exam. He reported drinking raw camel milk three months before the first episode of pain with a family member who was diagnosed with brucellosis recently. There was no tuberculosis contact. Since the patient was suspected to have neurobrucellosis, lumbar puncture was done. CSF analysis showed a WBC count of 420 (polymorphonuclear cells of 4% and lymphocytes of 90%) cells/mm3, RBC count of 18 cells/mm3, elevated protein level at 2.45 g/L and glucose level of 21.6 mg/dL (serum glucose was 81 mg/dL). The CSF culture was positive for Brucella species. The acid fast bacilli stain and culture were negative, as well as the MTB-PCR. Other investigations including tests for hepatitis B and C viruses and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 and 2 were all negative. Serologically, antibody titers results from the CSF for B. melitensis and B. abortuswere 1:160 and 1:80, respectively. His serum titers were not obtained initially. His CRP level was within normal limits. The patient refused to have a tuberculin skin test. An MRI of lumbosacral spine revealed enhancement of cauda equina nerve roots and surface of thecal sac, as well as L5-S1 degenerative changes with central posterior disc bulge indenting the ventral aspect of the thecal sac with no significant neural compromise associated with intervertebral disc dehydration (Image 3). He was admitted as a case of cauda equina syndrome secondary to neurobrucellosis and was started on ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 h, amikacin 500 mg IV every 8 h, doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 900 mg orally once daily. The initial plan was to continue the antibiotics with daily physiotherapy then re-evaluate after 6 weeks. However, two weeks into the treatment, the patient's status deteriorated significantly, from difficulty walking to being completely bed bound. Repeated work up showed no other significant findings. Furthermore, after 4 weeks of treatment, the patient started complaining of decreased hearing and pain in both ears resulted in discontinuation of amikacin. Six weeks into therapy, a repeated lumbar puncture did not show a significant improvement with a CSF analysis showing a WBC count of 315 cells/mm3 (polymorphonuclear cells of 41% and lymphocytes of 45%), RBC count of 15 cells/mm3, protein of 3.73 g/L and glucose level of 23.4 mg/dL (serum glucose was 82 mg/dL). Serum antibody titers were 1:320 and 1:80 for B. melitensis and B. abortus, respectively. Since the CSF repeated culture returned negative for Brucella spp., prednisone 1 mg/kg tapering dose was added aiming to reduce further nerve impingement. Luckily, the patient started to show clinical improvement and the IV ceftriaxone was discontinued after completing six weeks of treatment. The patient continued to restore his lower limb power and he was able to transfer to the wheelchair independently. Hence, he was discharged on doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 900 mg orally once daily for one year. The patient was scheduled for follow up in both the infectious diseases and neurology clinics. On his outpatient visits, the patient showed remarkable improvement of his lower limb weakness and he restored the ability to walk again using a cane. Serum antibody titers for both Brucella strains were at 1:80 and CRP remained within the normal range.\",\n",

This was associated with frontal headache, night sweats, rigors, chills, generalized body ache, unintentional weight loss of 3-4 kg and pain in the lower back and right leg. She reported regular consumption of raw cheese. Investigational workup was done upon admission where a CSF analysis showed 8 cells/mm3 of WBCs (no differential was done), 12 cells/mm3 of RBCs, 0.36 g/L of protein and 54 mg/dL of glucose (serum glucose was not obtained). Blood CRP level was 36 mg/L. She was admitted as a case of possible bacterial meningitis with suspicion of neurobrucellosis. The patient was started on ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily. Three days later, her blood culture returned positive for Brucella spp., However the CSF culture was negative, as well as the AFB stain. Serological testing for hepatitis B and C viruses and HIV 1 and 2 were all negative. High antibody titers for both B. melitensis and B. abortus of 1:1280 were found in the serum whereas it was negative in the CSF.

During hospitalization, the patient felt generally better and became afebrile. After completing the IV antibiotics course (ceftriaxone and amikacin), lumbar puncture was ordered, but the patient refused to undergo the procedure. Consequently, the patient was discharged on doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 900 mg orally once daily for 6 months. During her follow up visits, the patient reported feeling well and afebrile with remarkable improvement of the headache.

This regimen helped managing his symptoms; however, they were not resolved rendering him seeking medical help at our institution. There were no histories of contact with a tuberculosis patient or raw milk consumption. On physical examination, his scrotum was enlarged, swollen and tender. An ultrasound revealed both testes were of normal size; however, there was bilateral significant increased vascularity in both testicles and both epididymal heads. The scrotal skin was not thickened. There was a slightly increased echogenicity of both testes and a small left hydrocele was identified.\\nThere were a few (about four) tiny echogenic foci noted within the left testicle likely representing small calcifications. Physical examination findings of regional lymph nodes and skin were not significant. While awaiting other investigations, the patient was started on ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 12 h as an empiric therapy. Blood culture came back negative for Brucella spp.; however, antibody titers were positive for B. melitensis and B. abortus at 1:1280 for both strains. CRP level was 6.8 mg/L. The patient was diagnosed with Brucella epididymo-orchitis, but refused to undergo lumbar puncture for further investigation. Due to lack of clinical improvement, ciprofloxacin was discontinued three days later and was replaced by ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 12 h, doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 900 mg orally once daily. After two doses of 900 mg rifampin, the dose was decreased to 600 mg orally once daily though nothing in the patient's notes indicated the reason for the dose change nor the liver enzymes were elevated. After ten days of treatment, ceftriaxone was stopped and the patient was discharged on doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 600 mg orally once daily for a minimum period of three months. Before discharge, the patient was clinically improving as demonstrated by the decreased swelling and tenderness of his scrotum. On his first visit as an outpatient 2 weeks after discharge, the patient reported no new complications and appeared clinically well. Tests showed no signs of drug-induced hepatotoxicity, so the rifampin dose was increased to 900 mg orally once daily. On examination, his scrotum appeared to be relieved of the swelling and decreased in size. CRP level decreased slightly to 5.21 mg/L. A week later, the patient came again for follow up. While the patient did not show up for the next visit, his Brucella epididymoorchitis was deemed cured based on the improved clinical findings and decreased CRP. No repeated serology was done.\",\n",
